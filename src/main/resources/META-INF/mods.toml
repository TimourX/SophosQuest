description='''
Sophos Quest is a mod which add a lot of items, blocks, mobs, weapons and armors.

It's very much inspired by the Monster Hunter Generation Ultimate game, but I still wanted to create my own story, even though I kept a few monsters, a few weapons and some armor.

I hope you'll enjoy it ;)
