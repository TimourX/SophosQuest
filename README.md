# SophosQuest
----------------
I present you my first mod, SophosQuest. It's a mod largely inspired by the famous game Monster Hunter Generation Ultimate, but I've greatly modified the story. I kept some weapons, some items and some Monster Hunter entities.

The goal of the mod is to defeat the Furucaria, a gigantic and devastating monster. To do this you will need the power of the earth to find minerals, and a great deal of knowledge to forge the ultimate sword, the Sophos Blade. To forge it, you'll need to travel through dimensions, escape hostile monsters and defeat bosses.

## Features

### Earth Crystal:
- The earth crystal is a new gem that can be used as an abrasive for weapons and tools, when crafted into an abrasive block;

- You can make solid tools out of it, but not very effective ones. Stronger but less effective than stone;

- Earth crystal armor is stronger than iron armor, but less strong than diamond armor. It has 5% knockback resistance, and the armor is more damaging to the weapons than normal. When you hit with a sword someone wearing an earth crystal helmet, the sword will take more damage. The sword will take even more damage if the person wears full armor. Only earth crystal tools are immune to this;

- You can make a block of earth crystal with 9 earth crystal;

- The earth crystal ore is found in the overworld, and it is pretty common, but you can't find it very deeply. You get one or two earth crystals when you mine it, and you can smelt it (or blast it) to always get two;

- The abrasive block is a new block that allows you to repair your weapons and tools using neither materials nor experience. You will need an earth crystal block, 2 earth crystals, an anvil and 3 iron ingots to craft it. Just right click on the block, and it will decrease the damage to your weapons and tools. By dint of using it, it will turn into a chipped abrasive block, then into a damaged abrasive block, then it will break.

---

### Fossil:
- You can find fossil by mining a fossil block in the overworld. They're very rare, but they're found in a lot of layers. You will need a diamond or netherite pickaxe to mine it;

- Use the fossil to craft the Petrified Blade, the first stage of the Sophos Blade;

---

### Moofah:
- The moofah will be a new entity (in development);

- The moofah fur is a new item that you will use to craft a new magic armor, the moofah fur armor;

- The moofah fur armor is a new dyeable armor, that is less resistant than the leather armor, but it gives the effect of slow falling and resistance when you have the complete set. You will need moofah furs and moofah fleeceballs to craft it;

- The moofah fleeceball is a new block. Craft it with 9 moofah furs;

---

### Petrified Blade:
- This sword is very important. It is made with 4 iron ingots, an earth crystal, and a fossil, and you will have to improve it to be able to defeat the Furucaria. This is the first stage of the Sophos blade.

- This sword is important, but not very powerful. It does 3 hearts of damage, and it has a cooldown longer than normal swords.

## Future Features

- [ ] **Moofah:** This animal (from Monster Hunter universe) is like a mix between a sheep and a llama, with horns (sounds kind of weird). Search on Google, you'll find it;

- [ ] **Moofah Horn:** This item will be used to craft a new effect (already added but not yet finished);

- [ ] **Moofah Meat:** This is a new food (already added but not yet finished);

- [ ] **Wide-Range:** This effect will allow us to pass on the care we use to friends who play with us, or to members of our team. For example, if we take a regeneration potion with the Wide-Range effect, the regeneration effect will also be given to our friends in a certain radius. You will need a Moofah horn to craft a potion with this effect;
